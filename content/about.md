Hi, I’m James Ma. I’m a Product Manager based out of Toronto Canada. I work with teams to build products across a broad range of industries e.g.  theatrical lighting design, print media, mobile travel, health & wellness, B2B enterprise and developer tooling. My areas of interest include product and strategy analysis with a heavy leaning towards technology and software. I’ve been known to rant about product development and product design practices.

I was born in Hong Kong and raised in Toronto, Canada. I am currently working and living in Seattle, Washington. I studied Computer Science at the University of Toronto for my undergrad. I could sort a list if I had to, but in general I should never be trusted to write production software.

Ramen is my favorite food.
