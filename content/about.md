Hi, I’m James Ma, a Product Manager living in Seattle, Washington. I work with teams to build products across a broad range of industries e.g.  theatrical lighting design, print media, mobile travel, health & wellness, B2B enterprise and developer tooling. My areas of interest include product strategy and analysi's with a strong bias towards technology and software.

I was born in Hong Kong and raised in Toronto, Canada. I am currently working and living in Seattle, Washington. I studied Computer Science at the University of Toronto for my undergrad. I like to code, but I should never be trusted to write production software.

Ramen is my favorite food.
